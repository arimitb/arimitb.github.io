                    <h3>So did we succeed in copying the original picture?</h3>
                    <p>On one hand, if we look at the images from a pragmatic point of view, then we did manage to recreate the key elements of the photograph. Sure—the tree is now a plant, and the man on the left has a different nose—but our photo conveys the gist of the elements you see in the photo.<br><br>But is that enough?</p>

                <div class="right-text">
                    <h3>Does our photo really convey everything the original did?</h3>
                    <p>If you read about the original photo (titled “Guerrillero Heroico”), you’ll come across a lot of backstory regarding how the photo was taken at a memorial service after an explosion, about the subsequent events in the following years which added meaning to the photograph in retrospect, and about Che’s unwavering personality which shined through in the photo. Did we really capture all that? Is the sentiment people have towards the original something that can be achieved in a copy?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="center-text">
                    <p>Perhaps this leads us to a broader question—does being aware that something is a copy affect our perception of it? If so, how? In that context, is there even such a thing as a perfect copy?
                    <br><br>
                    These are questions I’ve yet to answer, but the knowledge that it is a matter of perspective and whether someone is aware of data’s copied nature is an interesting tool, and one that many designers often use to make their work feel more exclusive and special to the user.
