                    <p>I kept text usage to a minimum (only for page numbers), as I wanted the images to take the spotlight and tell the story.</p>

                    <h3>Did combining the images result in a new story, one not found in any of the individual images used?</h3>
                    <p>As the story of the zine revolves around an anti-consumerist narrative, a large portion of the images used can be treated as examples. But while the zine may incite a sense of anti-consumerism, that meaning is not extrapolated from any single image it contains.</p>

                <div class="right-text">
                    <h3>Can this story be independent of its sources?</h3>
                    <p>This is a difficult question to answer in this context, as the medium that the story is presented in is so closely interlinked with the images it utilises. One could argue that conveying it through text would make it independent. However, I believe the accuracy of that translation between mediums would be debatable.</p>
