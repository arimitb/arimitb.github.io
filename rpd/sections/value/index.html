                    <h3>I, along with Alex Villacis and Isa Defesche, created an installation which revolved around the value of data and the transactions that occur around it.</h3>
                    <p>We did so by designing a game which gets easier the more personal data the player sacrifices. The personal data was collected via a completely optional questionnaire, which ranged from simple personal details such as the player’s name and gender, to questions diving into the colour of their underwear and what they had for breakfast that morning.</p>

                    <p>We also incorporated a leaderboard into the installation in order to incite a sense of competitiveness into the players.</p>

                    <p>Here’s some footage of the game in action:</p>

                <div class="video">
                    <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/378841217?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

                    <p>To our surprise, after struggling with the game on its hardest difficulty (i.e. without having answered any questions) once or twice, most players ended up answering all the questions in order to make the game easier. Most of them even answered the questions truthfully, despite there not being any repercussions to writing random answers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="right-text">
                    <p>After each round, the player would be handed a receipt with all their data as well as their highscore, a copy of which would be stuck to a board. It’s interesting to note that the players were aware that the information they give would be displayed publicly on the board.</p>

            <section id="reflection">
                <div class="center-text">
                    <h3>So did these people not value their data? Or did they make a conscious decision weighing the pros and cons of sharing their answer to each question?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="left-text">
                    <p>It is hard to say for certain, but it would have been interesting to test their boundaries even further—asking questions which are increasingly personal until most players’ hesitance turns into refusal (or lying). They certainly seemed to be more comfortable sharing the information regarding their name, age, and gender as compared to the colour of their underwear.<br><br>It’s also interesting that since all the questions were optional, players could have answered the more personal questions without answering questions which identify them, such as their name. However, we didn’t see that occur at any point.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="right-text">
                    <p>The game, of course, was simply an analogy. In real life, these transactions are a lot less explicit and a lot more discreet. Being asked for your email in order to download a file, revealing your name and address in order to vote, accepting cookies which may be used for tracking in order to access a website—these are all examples of transactions of data which occur in our daily lives.<br><br>Being aware of these transactions helps us as participants in bargaining, fighting for what in monetary terms would be considered a “fair price”. It is certainly a significant shift in mindset, but one which more accurately reflects the underlying mechanisms of how a lot of modern-day businesses function.</p>
