                    <h3>I, along with Alex Villacis and Isa Defesche, created an installation which visualised the data collection and analysis that occurs in the background while browsing social media platforms.  It shows not only quantitative data, but also associative data displaying the relationships between people, organisations and events that are observed in relation to the pictures you see on, in this case, Instagram.</h3>

                    <h3>Who benefits from this data analysis?</h3>
                    <p>It is widely known that Instagram uses the data regarding which posts you like or interact with, and which ones you disregard, in order to decide which content to serve you next. This allows them to keep their users on the platform for longer periods of time, which in turn appeals to advertisers and increases their ad revenue.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="right-text">
                    <h3>This is just one of many examples. Data analysis is a massive field which plays a huge role in many aspects of business. But is that the only role of data analysis? Is it always for profit?</h3>
                    <p>It could be argued that most actions taken by companies are for profit, but a majority of research that benefits us also stems from data analysis. Data analysis is a tool, similar to most other aspects of data discussed in this document. And like any other tool, its uses range anywhere from highly benevolent to extremely malicious.</p>

                    <p>To do so, I scraped almost 4000 tweets from Twitter and performed sentiment analysis on them to classify them as either positive or negative.</p>

                <div class="left-text">
                    <h3>Did I violate the author’s consent when I scraped the tweets?</h3>
                    <p>Setting aside the objective legality of my actions, it is easy to say that the tweets were subject to analysis the moment they were posted, and hence their consent is insignificant to my analysis. However, consent can be limited to analysis by a particular individual or organisation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="right-text">
                    <h3>Does the fact that I don’t display the authors’ names, and that I don’t use the analysis for malicious purposes, affect how my actions are perceived?</h3>
                    <p>They certainly do shift the needle in a school setting, as no one seems to mind data scraping in the context in which I did it. This may or may not be indicative of the sentiment of the authors of the tweets, but it certainly gives us an idea of how public opinion on data analysis shifts as the purpose and context change.</p>
