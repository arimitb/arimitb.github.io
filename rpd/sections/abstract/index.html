                    <p>The raw data being abstracted in this case are the physical horizons themselves.</p>
                    <h3>Does my abstraction which turns them into lines make them easier to digest?</h3>

                <div class="right-text">
                    <p>Probably not. However, it does make the horizon’s connection to the audio easier to visualise. In this case, the abstraction removed data from the source in order to make it easier to consume.</p>

                    <h3>I, along with Alex Villacis and Isa Defesche, created an installation which took the Instagram interface and visualised the data collection and analysis that occurs as you interact with it.</h3>
                    <p>Here is a video visualising the concept:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="video">
                    <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/378838576?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                    <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
                </div>
                <div class="right-text">
                    <p>The visualisation itself is also massively simplified and abstracted. Despite that, it creates a sense of overwhelm that struck people during the installation, as they could see the data packets and the neural network.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="visual-essay">
                <div class="left-text">
                    <h3>Another project which minimised data abstraction was a visual essay I created.</h3>
                    <p>The essay visualised the shift in public opinion regarding controversial events. I scraped almost 4000 tweets from Twitter, using a sentiment analysis tool to classify them as either positive or negative.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="right-text">
                    <p>The way I displayed this data was paramount to this project. I wanted to abstract the data as little as possible, in order to convey not only how positive or negative the opinions were, but also the difference in the amount of data between time periods and the accuracy of the analysis.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-text">
                    <img src="../../images/Projects/Visual_Essay-1.png">
                    <p>I decided that the best way to show all this information would be to display the tweets themselves. Doing so shows the ratio of positive to negative tweets, while also visually indicating the aggregate length of tweets and letting the viewer read them up close in order to judge the accuracy themselves.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="left-text">
                    <h3>So how does minimising the abstraction of data affect these projects?</h3>
                    <p>In the social media visualisation, it made the data harder to interpret. While it is interesting to convey the sense of overwhelm, it ended up being detrimental to the project as the several aspects of data competing for the audience’s focus ended up detracting from how well the project communicated its focal point.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="right-text">
                    <p>In the visual essay, on the other hand, it not only contributed to the viewer’s understanding of the data, but actually simplified it to its essentials. This helped give the document a very clear focus, and increased the readability of the project. Having a clear hierarchy in the typography also contributed to this readability.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="center-text">
                    <p>So the abstraction of data can sometimes make data clearer, while at other times confuse the viewer. It’s highly context dependant, but according to my observations from the projects, it depends on what kind of data the viewer might encounter regularly. Programmers who are used to seeing code on a regular basis would derive a lot of meaning from seeing the Instagram’s server-end source code, but it would not mean nearly as much to the average viewer. As such, having a clear target audience is the key to determining the level of abstraction appropriate for how certain data should be conveyed.</p>
