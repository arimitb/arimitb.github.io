                    <p>This image has some obvious (and plenty of non-obvious) influences at display. I started off by listing the things I knew about the image, the things I could derive from the image, and the things I did not know about the image.<br><br>I did this for each of the “origins” as well (emphasis on the plurality), the first of which was Obama’s “HOPE” poster. I repeated this exercise several times, as I recursively kept finding new influences to each image.</p>

                    <h3>So did I succeed in finding the original?</h3>
                    <p>Yes and no. My personal definition of the term “original” changed as I conducted this experiment. Rather than thinking about an original as a singular entity, I started thinking about it as a set of influences all of which culminate in the work being analysed.</p>

                    <h3>Then what is originality?</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the long lineage of influences, we find that some works build upon their predecessors more than others (via remix, AKA <i>(spoiler alert)</i> “Manipulation”). As such, I believe originality to be a spectrum, which ranges from what the populous intuitively considers a “copy” or a duplicate to what is typically considered an original.</p>
