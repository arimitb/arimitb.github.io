                    <h3>So did the images lose their original meaning?</h3>
                    <p>I believe the meaning of the images was “manipulated” to a certain extent. More than the visual properties of the images, it is stacking the contexts surrounding them which lend their meaning to the resulting collages.</p>

                    <h3>If someone encounters these collages without having seen their sources, would they form a different interpretation of these images?</h3>
                    <p>Looking at the collages in a vacuum (whatever that might mean in a practical context), the collages would only retain the meaning that they carry via their visual properties. Stripping away the contextual meaning, we are left with a sliver of the substance that they previously had.</p>
